# Skredvarsel Privacy Policy

The Skredvarsel app does not collect or store any user data.

If you give the app permission to access your location, it will only request a location with an accuracy of three kilometers, and the resolved location is only passed to the Varsom.no API end-point as part of the query to retrieve local avalanche warnings for your current region.

For more information about the Varsom.no API hosted by the the Norwegian Avalanche Warning Service please see http://api.nve.no/doc/snoeskredvarsel/.

All the source code for the application is available as open source and can be received to verify that no data is collected by this app.
