# Skredvarsel / iVarsom

The Skredvarsel (Avalanche warning) app is an iOS, iPadOS, and macOS application that provides daily avalanche warnings from the [Norwegian Avalanche Warning Service API](http://api.nve.no/doc/snoeskredvarsel/).

The main feature of the app is a set of beautiful widgets that can be added to the home screen on iOS and iPadOS, or the notification center on macOS. It is not intended to replace the official [Varsom Regobs app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/varsom-regobs/id1450501601), but rather complement it with an app taking full advantage of the Apple platforms. Hence the code name iVarsom.

The app is also a learning exercise for myself to learn how to build and distribute a SwiftUI app for iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS.
