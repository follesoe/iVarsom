I am happy to announce that the Skredvarsel app is ready for its third season, with a v3.0 release.

The most significant new feature is that avalanche problems are now shown in the app, and the app has been updated to support iOS 17, watchOS 10, and macOS 14.

- Avalanche problems are now included in the forecast view
- You can read the extended warning text by tapping the warning summary on the top of the details page
- Adds support for iOS 17 standby mode widgets
- Updated the watchOS app to follow the new watchOS 10 design guidelines

Stay safe, and happy season!
